# React Data Loader [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lucasconstantino/react-data-loader.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lucasconstantino/react-data-loader)

> Dead simple data loader helper for React

## Disclaimer

Use it not for big projects! If you project needs lots of API communication you'll be probably better off using tools such as [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/) (I personally recommend [Apollo](https://www.apollodata.com/) for that task) or even [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) with [`redux-thunk`](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk). Sometimes, though, these are too much.

## Why this package?

When loading external data in a React component - be it on user interaction or during mounting phase - we end up rewriting the same logic all over again: loading status, error responses, etc. This could be much simpler and a lot more standardized. Nowadays we use component composition and Higher-Order Components and they are cool. Let's use them.

## Inspiration

I've lately being coding most of my projects using the Apollo stack. As with any API client, the [Apollo/React](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo) integration package provides easy data [request status and meta information](http://dev.apollodata.com/react/queries.html#default-result-props), right in the component as a simple prop. I wanted that when coding simpler projects too, but without API setup hassle :)

## Install

`yarn add react-data-loader`

> Or, good ol' `npm install --save react-data-loader`

## Usage

### Simple as can

```js
import { withDataLoader } from 'react-data-loader'

const MyDataLoaderComponent = ({ someProp }) => (
  <div>
    { JSON.stringify(someProp.data) }
    <button onClick={ someProp.load } disabled={ someProp.loading }>Load!</button>
  </div>
)

// Using Fetch API.
const loader = props => e => fetch('/api/data.json').then(res => res.json())

export default withDataLoader('someProp', loader)(MyDataLoaderComponent)
```
